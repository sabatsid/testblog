<div class="aboutus">
<p> Many may argue that this power is not possessed by everyone which is exactly why I feel that they are taking it for granted. 
<br> People believe it is just possessed by talented and creative homo sapiens. <br> </p>
<p>However, I believe that as a human we all are born with this superpower. <br>
 The superpower I’m talking about is the ability of human beings to indulge in, participate and create any form of art.</p>
<p><i>Who is a superhero? If I was asked this question then any day my answer would be the same.</i></p>
<p>A superhero is someone who believes in himself and his potentials independent of the fact that how powerful his superpowers really are.<br> 
He may or may not be born with superpowers but the decisions and skill to use those solely remain with him and him alone.</p>
<p>Art is not just drawing or painting, it is the ability to let one’s creativity capture one’s mind and make one think out of the box.
 Every art is beautiful, every art is unique, every art is worthy.
<br><b>We all are artists, Curiosity creates us, Creativity carves us!</b></p>
Art is something only human beings can do.Hence, I believe that all human beings are artists by birth. 
Most of them don’t succeed in actually developing that artist within them and that’s why they end up not recognizing their potential at all.<br>
With the aim to run the race of our lives, we are in some way neglecting the things that we actually once loved.
<p>Just close your eyes and think about the moment you felt extremely thrilled while doing a job which wasn’t a part of your routine task.<br> 
The mere thought of it brings a smile on your face, right? Well, no one is stopping you to embrace it. Go on.<br>
Superpowers are never used by heroes to earn their bread. 
So I won’t suggest you to make your superpower a way to sustain your livelihood but I sure would like to say that stop taking it for granted 
because we are the only species with the power to enjoy different forms of arts. 
Indulge in those activities whenever you are free, make it a point to get lost in them when you are sad and lastly superpowers are used to help others. 
So if any of your art brings a smile on someone else’s face in addition to your own then that power is truly super.</p>
